Scratch is a free programming language and online community where you can create your own interactive stories, games, and animations.
Its so intresting that it can eat up your time.
you can add loops, characters, sounds and so much more by just dragging and droping.
I have created a Covid-19 Scratch using Abby and Susan. It took me 8 hours straight to figure out the idea and implement it.
